Movie Genre Classification Project

This project aims to develop a genre classification model for movie plot summaries using natural language processing techniques. Two different approaches are explored: one using traditional machine learning algorithms and the other using transformer-based models with BERT base uncased architecture.

Description

Genre classification of movies is a fundamental task in the field of natural language processing (NLP). By analyzing the plot summaries of movies, I aim to predict their genres accurately. Two different methods are implemented and compared in this project: a traditional machine learning approach and a transformer-based approach using the BERT base uncased model.

Files

ml_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing code for the genre classification model using traditional machine learning algorithms.
transformer_model.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing code for the genre classification model using transformer-based models with the BERT base uncased architecture.

Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the respective Jupyter notebooks for each approach (ml_model.ipynb for the traditional machine learning approach and transformer_model.ipynb for the transformer-based approach).
Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the code and train the models.
Experiment with different parameters and hyperparameters to optimize the model performance.

Dependencies

Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
scikit-learn
Transformers
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the backend used by Transformers)
